/**
 * electron-builder afterPack hook: ad-hoc sign the macOS app bundle.
 *
 * Without a Developer ID certificate electron-builder skips signing and ships
 * Electron's bare per-binary signatures (arm64: linker-signed, x64: none) with
 * no bundle seal. macOS rejects a downloaded copy of that bundle as "FTune is
 * damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash." — a dead end
 * with no Open Anyway button. A complete ad-hoc signature (identity "-") turns
 * it into an ordinary unnotarized app the user can allow once in
 * System Settings → Privacy & Security.
 *
 * Hardened runtime stays off: an ad-hoc signature has no Team ID, so library
 * validation would refuse to load Electron Framework and the app would crash
 * at launch. When a Developer ID is configured, electron-builder's own signing
 * pass runs after this hook and re-signs everything with --force.
