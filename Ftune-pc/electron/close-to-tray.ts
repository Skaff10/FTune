 * - Windows closes to the tray while Settings' "Close to tray" is on and the tray icon is there: FTune keeps
 *   running, quiet until you press play (the tray, the media keys or the miniplayer can). Without the icon
 *   nothing could bring the window back or quit, so it closes (and FTune quits) as it always did.
