/**
 * Rooms (listen together), the network side, all in main: the functions of
 * supabase/migrations/0002-rooms.sql, and the room's private Realtime channel "room:<id>". The page
 * gets the room's state (checked by lib/roomSync) and this computer's clock offset to the server's,
 * and asks for changes through IPC; it never talks to Supabase.
 *
 * While in a room: the clock is measured on entering and on waking from sleep; a ping every 30 s
 * keeps presence, the clock and any missed update fresh; a dropped channel re-subscribes with
 * backoff (1 s doubling to 30 s) and reads the room again. Nothing runs outside a room.
 *
 * The listener's own queue is set aside while in a room (store "room-stash", main-only, written by
 * the page). If ByTune quits or crashes in a room, the next start leaves that room and the page
 * puts the queue back.
